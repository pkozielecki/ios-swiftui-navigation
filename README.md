# SwiftUI Navigation Showcase

Welcome to the demonstration of **different ways** to implement **scalable navigation** in **SwiftUI** projects.

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/pkozielecki/ios-swiftui-navigation/actions/workflows/ios.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pkozielecki/ios-swiftui-navigation/actions/workflows/ios.yml)

## Main Features
Showcase of 2 most reliable, currently available ways to implement SwiftUI navigation:
* using **SwiftUIRouter** component
* using **UIKit-based navigation**

The grounds on which to assess the navigation solutions are:
* **precision** - we can define precisely which view (and how) will be shown 
* **scalability** - as the application grows, the navigation component allows adding new views and app flows 
* **being stateful** - it is possible to set up or restore the entire navigation stack (e.g. when activating a deep link)
* an ability to **self-dismiss** - a popup or a view can be dismissed / popped programmatically 
* **testability** - it is possible to test the navigation component in isolation

## Integration

### Requirements
* iOS 16.0 (SwiftUI-based navi)
* iOS 13.0 (UIKit-based navi)

### Running the app

* Clone the repo.
* Open `SwiftUI Navigation.xcodeproj` file.
* Edit `AppConfiguration.swift` file and enter valid https://metalpriceapi.com/ API key.
* Use `SwiftUI Navigation` scheme to run the application.
* Use `Tests` scheme to run unit tests.

## Showcased navigation types
* SwiftUI Router [see below](#swiftui-router)
* UIKit-based navigation [see below](#uikit-based-navigation)

### SwiftUI Router

Utilises iOS 16 `Navigation Stack` and `navigationDestination` API to handle navigation
* Uses `Router` component to execute navigation commands (e.g. push, pop, present, etc.)
* The `Router` is bound strictly with the View implementing `Navigation Stack`
* API very similar to `UINavigationController`

#### Using SwiftUI Router

This type of navigation relies on 2 components bound together:
* A SwiftUI `Root View`:
  * Embeds `NavigationStack` component.
  * Implements `@ViewBuilder` functions that creates subviews to show in the NavStack.
  * Implements **view modifiers** telling the compiler how to present a particular view (e.g. as sheet or an alert)
  * Sample implementation [see below](#view-example), [go to code](https://github.com/pkozielecki/ios-swiftui-navigation/blob/main/SwiftUI%20Navigation/SwiftUI%20Navigation/SwiftUI%20Router/Router/SwiftUIRouterHomeView.swift)

* A `Router`:
  * A single source of truth about what view is shown at a given moment.
  * Provides reference to the navigation stack.
  * Implements methods to operate on the navigation stack (e.g. push, pop, return to root, etc.)
  * Protocol definition [see below](#router-protocol-definition)
  * Sample implementation [go to code](https://github.com/pkozielecki/ios-swiftui-navigation/blob/main/SwiftUI%20Navigation/SwiftUI%20Navigation/SwiftUI%20Router/Router/SwiftUINavigationRouter.swift)

##### View Example
```
struct SwiftUIRouterHomeView<Router: NavigationRouter>: View {
    @ObservedObject var router: Router

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(
            path: .init(
                get: {
                    router.navigationStack
                },
                set: { stack in
                    router.set(navigationStack: stack)
                })
        ) {
            MyInitialView()
                .navigationDestination(for: NavigationRoute.self) { route in
                    //  Handling app screens, pushed to the navigation stack
                }
                .sheet(item: $router.presentedPopup) { _ in
                    if let $popup = Binding($router.presentedPopup) {
                        //  Handling app popups, presented as sheets:
                    }
                }
                .alert(
                    presenting: $router.presentedAlert,
                    confirmationActionTitle: router.presentedAlert?.title.orEmpty,
                    confirmationActionCallback: { alertRoute in
                        //  Handling app alert confirmation action:
                    }
                )
        }
    }
}
```

##### Router protocol definition
```
protocol NavigationRouter: AnyObject, ObservableObject {

    /// A currently presented popup.
    var presentedPopup: PopupRoute? { get set }
    var presentedPopupPublished: Published<PopupRoute?> { get }
    var presentedPopupPublisher: Published<PopupRoute?>.Publisher { get }

    /// A currently presented alert.
    var presentedAlert: AlertRoute? { get set }
    var presentedAlertPublished: Published<AlertRoute?> { get }
    var presentedAlertPublisher: Published<AlertRoute?>.Publisher { get }

    /// A currently presented navigation route.
    var navigationRoute: NavigationRoute? { get }

    /// A complete navigation stack.
    /// Contains all navigation routes pushed to navigation stack.
    var navigationStack: [NavigationRoute] { get }

    /// Pushes screen to navigation stack.
    ///
    /// - Parameter screen: a screen to be pushed.
    func push(screen: NavigationRoute.Screen)

    /// Removes last view from the navigation stack.
    func pop()

    /// Pops navigation stack to root.
    func popAll()

    /// Replaces navigation stack.
    ///
    /// - Parameter navigationStack: a collection of routes to replace the stack with.
    func set(navigationStack: [NavigationRoute])

    /// Presents provided popup as sheet.
    ///
    /// - Parameter popup: a popup to present.
    func present(popup: PopupRoute.Popup)

    /// Dismisses current popup.
    func dismiss()

    /// Shows an alert.
    ///
    /// - Parameter alert: an alert to show.
    func show(alert: AlertRoute.Alert)

    /// Removes currently displayed alert from the navigation stack.
    func hideCurrentAlert()
}
```

#### Pros:
* **Precise**<br/>You can explicitly set which View is shown (and how) - though itâ€™s not as clear as in UIKit (e.g. separate bindings exposed for controlling an alert, popup and navigation stack).
* **Scalable** to a degree<br/>You can display independent app flow on a popup, that opens another popup showing yet another flow, etc.
* **Stateful**<br/>You can save navigation path and then restore it on the Router to trigger Root View / Navigation Stack rebuilding the Views (a.k.a. drill-down navigation).
* **Testable**<br/>Router is fully testable. Router + Root View binding can be tested using integration tests like Snapshots.

#### Cons:
* iOS 16+ only<br/>requires `Navigation Stack`.
* Tight coupling between the `Root View` (the one with embedded NavigationStack) and the `Router`.
* Messy View factories in the Root View (thanks to `@ViewBuilder`). 
* Only a single alert or popup can be shown at a given moment.

#### Where to use:
* **Simple project, POC, etc.**<br/>Rule of the thumb: if we can manage with just one NavigationStack in the app, you'll be ok.
* **SwiftUI-only modules**<br/>Such modules have limited amount of screens to show and distinct point of entry where the these screens

### UIKit-based navigation

* Implements the navigation classical way - using `UINavigationController`
* SwiftUI Views are embedded into `HostingViewControllers`
* Uses a single point of entry to execute navigation commands - `UIKitNavigationRouter`
* Leverages `FlowCoordinator` to handle navigation flow for a given feature (e.g. registration, authentication, etc.)
* Every view shown is represented by a distinct `Route` object

#### Using UIKit-based navigation

This type of navigation relies on 4 components / concepts:
* A `Route`:
    * Represents an unique `View Component`: a single view or an entire app flow. 
    * Must have n unique name across the app.
    * Protocol definition [see below](#route-protocol-definition).
* A `View Component`:
  * A convenience wrapper for a view.<br/>A `UIViewController` wrapping a SwiftUI or a UIKit view.
  * Contains information about a `Route` it represents. 
* A `Flow Coordinator`:
  * Has knowledge about currently displayed view, including a popup. 
  * Has its own navigation stack (wrapped UINavigationController). 
  * Handles precisely defined set of Routes. 
  * Can display a `Route` in many ways, as defined in a given Route properties:
    * Inline - push a view(s) on navigation stack 
    * As a popup - present as popup (modality is defined in Route properties)
    * As a separate flow - starts a child flow 
  * Can go back to previously displayed routes:
    * Manually - by pressing back nav button. 
    * Programmatically - by calling `navigateBackTo(route:))`. 
  * Can switch to any supported route. 
  * Can embed or present a copy of itself as a child flow (a.k.a inception navigation). 
  * Can restore navigation state (e.g. entire sequence of views preceding a current one).
  * Protocol definition [see below](#flowcoordinator-protocol-definition).
* A `Router`:
  * A single point of entry for navigation.
  * Embeds all active Flow Coordinators, maintaining their hierarchy.
  * Has knowledge which of the active app flows is the currently shown to the user.
  * Protocol definition [see below](#router-protocol-definition).

To add a new flow into the app you need to:
* Create an object implementing `FlowCoordinator` protocol
* Implement `canShow(route:)` to set which `Routes` does the flow support.
* Implement `start()` & `stop()` methods to handle flow lifecycle.
* Implement `makeViewComponents(forRoute:)` method to produce a view for each supported `Route`.
* Implement `makeFlowCoordinator(forRoute:)` method to produce a child flow coordinator for a given `Route`.

**The remaining *mechanical* operations (like presenting a flow, handling back nav button, manually dismissing a popup, etc.) are provided by FlowCoordinator default implementation!<br/>[See example](https://github.com/pkozielecki/ios-swiftui-navigation/blob/0e397ba55138baff439f4df2c0c6bb136ff6d81d/SwiftUI%20Navigation/SwiftUI%20Navigation/UIKit%20Router/Flow%20Coordinator/FlowCoordinator.swift#L79)**

    /// The setter is exposed only to set Flow's child to nil after it's finished.
    var child: FlowCoordinator? { get set }

    /// A coordinator completion callback.
    var completionCallback: (() -> Void)? { get set }

    /// A starts the flow.

    /// Checks whether a route can be shown in the flow.
    ///
    /// - Parameter route: a route to check.
    /// - Returns: a flag indicating whether a route can be shown in the flow.
    func canShow(route: any Route) -> Bool

    /// Switches to a route.

    ///   - route: a route to navigate back to.
    ///   - animated: a flag indicating whether the navigation should be animated.

}
```
